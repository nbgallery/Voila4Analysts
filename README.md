**What is V4A?** This is a collection of tips and techniques for writing Jupyter notebooks that can also be executed as [Voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) dashboards.

**Who is this for?**  This guide may help anyone writing a Voila dashboard, but it is primarily aimed at code-savvy business analysts looking at Voila as a way to productionize their notebook for colleagues or management who do not need to modify the notebook or see the code.   Users of Voila4Analysts should be comfortable writing Python notebooks in Jupyter, preferably with some experience using ipywidgets.

**Why did we write V4A?**  Business analysts are domain experts and often have great experience using Python for data science and workflow automation, but they are less likely to have an intimate knowledge of the Jupyter and ipywidgets ecosystem.  While most notebooks transition easily to Voila, our analysts have found there's just enough friction that the process can be a little challenging.  Every tip in this guide is the result of working with our analysts to transition operational notebooks into production dashboards.

**How should you use V4A?**  The guide is formatted as Jupyter notebooks, so you can read it here on GitHub, or you can load the notebooks into Jupyter if you want to play with the examples.  You can also launch V4A in binder; we have the Voila preview set up for both the [classic notebook interface](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nbgallery/Voila4Analysts/main?filepath=Voila%204%20Analysts.ipynb) and [Jupyter Lab](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nbgallery/Voila4Analysts/main?urlpath=lab/tree/Voila%204%20Analysts.ipynb).
